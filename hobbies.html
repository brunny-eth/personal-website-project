<h2>Hobbies</h2>

<div class="page-intro">
    <p>I spend most of my time working at <a href="https://pluto.xyz/">Pluto</a> or tinkering
    <a href="{{ '/projects-ive-worked-on' | relative_url }}">on side projects</a>.</p>
    <p>When I get some free time, I learn more about the world. My main focus areas today are computer science and cryptography, but I also try to learn about some other unrelated topics I find interesting, like longevity, space exploration, and the deep intricacies of finance. I follow along to free online university resources, read books, listen to podcasts, and generally do my best to stay constantly curious about the world. </p>
    <p>I also like to cook, eat, play golf, and spend time with my family and friends.</p>

                    <div class="book-meta">
                        <strong>Description:</strong> A sci-fi trilogy that explores the centuries-long consequences of humanity's first contact with an alien civilization.

                    <div class="book-meta">
                        <strong>My thoughts:</strong> The best sci-fi books I've ever read. A unique perspective on humanity's place in the universe. Lots of game theory and technological optimism sprinkled throughout the 3 books... and plenty of dark, sobering pieces too.

                        <strong>My thoughts:</strong> For such a complicated technical topic, this book does a great job going through the history of how technologists went from 'electrons moving through a vacuum' to 'hundreds of billions of chips all around us'. Semi-technical but not dense at all.

                        <strong>My thoughts:</strong> I have many friends who strongly disagree with me on this one. Mostly, I just found it slow and boring. Reading it felt like driving down Nebraska cornfields for hours at a time - novel at first but the novelty wears off quickly.

                        <strong>My thoughts:</strong> Interesting, but far too long for my taste. Became redundant and repetitive. Almost turned me off from reading Walter Isaacson's Elon Musk biography, which I ended up finding much more interesting than this one. No disrespect intended to Steve Jobs, but far from my favorite book.

    <summary>Golf</summary>
    <div class="details-content">
        <p>When the weather permits, you can find me on the golf course. Golf pushes me to be outside in nature with friends, unplugged from the rest of the world and focused solely on getting the little white ball into the hole in as few strokes as possible. It's a mental and physical challenge and it takes tons of discipline to get good at golf (and I am very much still working on getting 'good' at golf).</p>
