## Personal website project

this is a hobby project to build a personal website from scratch and host it on a Raspberry Pi. 

i'll be running this on a [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B](https://vilros.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b-1?variant=40809478750302) and using Claude as my personal tutor. 

i'll also use this README to track progress

Have spent a few days now figuring out how to get this thing hosted on my Raspberry Pi. I ran into all sorts of trouble, like my ISP has dynamic IPs, so i had to potentially set up duckdns, but then it turns out Squarespace (where i bought my domain from and was planning on just using to set up the routing towards my Pi) doesnt allow dynamic DNS services like DuckDNS, AND my ISP doesnt allow for port forwarding bc of something to do with fiber? 

Lots of troubleshooting but I'm finally up. Had to make some changes to Jekyll builds and stylistic changes to pages to get them to work. 

#### 10-16-2024

Finished all initial content on the website, preparing site to be served via Raspberry Pi and connecting to domain.  

#### 10-15-2024

Finished initial draft of blog.md, hobbies.md, and got to work on stuff-ive-worked-on.md.

Spent the last few days working on the [slack-rss-bot](https://github.com/brunny-eth/slack-rss-bot) project, which delayed some work on this website project. Still have to make a few changes to rss bot so might take some focus away from here. My intention is to wrap this up in the next couple of weeks. Putting in content now and then will clean up final styling changes (for the time being) once all content is in.

Changed the 'blog and reading recommendations' to just have the blog; added reading recommendation to 'hobbies'. Tried working with Claude to fix a CSS bug but Claude was just making me do overcomplicated stuff so gave up for the night.

(Realized i forgot to update this README yesterday even though i worked on this project)

#### 10-07-2024

Added a 'hobbies' page with no content for now; fixed issue with tabs on top of screen being inconsistent across pages.

Added more blog posts to the site, fixed some more styling issues.

#### 10-06-2024

Added a couple of blog posts to the site, and fixed styling on the blog page. its requiring a lot of manual work to copy over my blog posts from [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/brunny.eth) into markdown for the site, but can't seem to find another way to do it. 

Lesson learned: future blog posts will just be written directly in markdown rather than using a site like Mirror. 

#### 10-04-2024

Set up the basic structure of the Jekyll project and imported CSS / index.html from prior set up work
