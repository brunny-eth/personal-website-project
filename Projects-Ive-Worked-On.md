        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Pluto is building applied cryptography developer tooling for application developers. Our first product is a Web Proofs SDK that enables application developers to incorporate 'Proofs of Web Activity' into their onchain applications. Web Proofs combine powerful cryptography like client-side proving and zero-knowledge proofs to unlock verifiable access to existing data sources on the Internet, like data that comes from Uber, Shopify, banking providers, attested sensors, e-mail clients, or any other internet server.</p>
