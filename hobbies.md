<h2>hobbies</h2>

<div class="page-intro">
    <p>I spend most of my time working at <a href="https://pluto.xyz/">Pluto</a> or tinkering on side projects.</p>
    <p>When I get some free time, I learn more about the world through a self-curated curriculum focused on a mix of computer science, cryptography, and a bunch of other unrelated topics I find interesting, like longevity, space exploration, and finance.</p>
    <p>I also like to read, cook (see my <a href="https://faint-smile-2e4.notion.site/Recipes-08b512690f054e58a760e17305632620">running list of recipes</a>), play golf, and hang out with my family, friends, and dog.</p>

## Personal curriculum

I spend at least a few hours a week going through materials from high-quality educational courses. Here are some of the best materials I've gone through recently:

- [Harvard's CS50 course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfaMVlDaQ24&t=2649s)
- [Tim Roughgarden's Foundation of Blockchains course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNJGPI0fuFA&list=PLEGCF-WLh2RLOHv_xUGLqRts_9JxrckiA)

## Reading

I'm an avid reader. Here are some of my favorites:

<div class="book-list">
  <div class="book-item">
    <h4>The Three-Body Problem Trilogy by Cixin Liu</h4>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A sci-fi trilogy that explores the centuries-long consequences of humanity's first contact with an alien civilization.</p>
    <p><strong>My thoughts:</strong> The best sci-fi books I've ever read. A unique perspective on humanity's place in the universe. Lots of game theory and technological optimism sprinkled throughout the 3 books... and plenty of dark, sobering pieces too.</p>
    <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 10/10</p>
  </div>

  <div class="book-item">
    <h4>The Chip by J.R. Reid</h4>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> How two Americans invented the silicon microchip and launched the global information industry.</p>
    <p><strong>My thoughts:</strong> For such a complicated technical topic, this book does a great job going through the history of how technologists went from 'electrons moving through a vacuum' to 'hundreds of billions of chips all around us'. Semi-technical but not dense at all.</p>
    <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 9/10</p>
  </div>

  <div class="book-item">
    <h4>Everything Happens For a Reason (and Other Lies I Love) by Kate Bowler</h4>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A young, newly-married mother gets diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer and grapples with her own mortality.</p>
    <p><strong>My thoughts:</strong> Phenomenal, inspiring book. Thought it would be very self-help-y but it was just beautiful.</p>
    <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 9/10</p>
  </div>

  <div class="book-item">
    <h4>Crypto by Steven Levy</h4>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The comprehensive history of cryptography and its impact on modern society. 'Crypto' tells the story of how a group of nerds and visionaries beat Big Brother to ensure our right to privacy on the Internet</p>
    <p><strong>My thoughts:</strong> Interesting, thought provoking. An underrated story about the war on crypto(graphy).</p>
    <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 9/10</p>
  </div>

   <div class="book-item">
    <h4>The Black Cloud by Fred Hoyle</h4>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A 1950s sci-fi novel about an 'alien' arrival to Earth, where the 'alien' is an enormous cloud of gas that seems likely to destroy Earth by blocking the Sun's radiation.</p>
    <p><strong>My thoughts:</strong> Really fun book. High quality writing that doesn't lose any power in the 70+ years since it first came out.</p>
    <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 9/10</p>

And here are some books that often appear on "Must Read" lists, but that I don't actually recommend to others:

  <div class="book-list overrated">
  <div class="book-item">
    <h4>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenace by Robert Pirsig</h4>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> A philosophical novel about a father-son motorcycle trip across America. </p>
    <p><strong>My thoughts:</strong> I have many friends who strongly disagree with me on this one. Mostly, I just found it slow and boring. Reading it felt like driving down Nebraska cornfields for hours at a time - novel at first but the novelty wears off quickly.</p>
    <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4/10</p>
  </div>

  <div class="book-item">
    <h4>Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman by Richard Feynman</h4>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> An edited collection of reminiscences by the Nobel Prizeâ€“winning physicist Richard Feynman. </p>
    <p><strong>My thoughts:</strong> I really wanted to like this book. And it *does* have lots of little gems. But his writing style had too much rambling / meandering into random directions for my liking.</p>
    <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 6/10</p>
  </div>

  <div class="book-item">
    <h4>Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson</h4>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The biography of Steve Jobs.</p>
    <p><strong>My thoughts:</strong> Interesting, but far too long for my taste. Became redundant and repetitive. Almost turned me off from reading Walter Isaacson's Elon Musk biography, which I ended up finding much more interesting than this one. No disrespect intended to Steve Jobs, but far from my favorite book.</p>
    <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/10</p>

## Cooking

I love experimenting in the kitchen. Check out my [running list of recipes](https://faint-smile-2e4.notion.site/Recipes-08b512690f054e58a760e17305632620) for some of my favorite dishes.

## Golf

When the weather permits, you can find me on the golf course. Golf has a bad reputation as an elitist country club sport. That can sometimes be true (depends where you play!). 

But golf also pushes me to be outside in nature, with a few friends and my phone away, unplugged from the rest of the world and focused solely on getting the little white ball into the hole in as few strokes as possible. It's a mental and physical challenge and it takes tons of discipline to get good at golf (I am still working on getting 'good' at golf).
