<h2>hobbies</h2>

<div class="page-intro">
    <p>I spend most of my time working at <a href="https://pluto.xyz/">Pluto</a> or tinkering on side projects.</p>
    <p>When I get some free time, I learn more about the world through a self-curated personal curriculum focused on a weird mix of topics - computer science, cryptography, and a bunch of other unrelated topics I find interesting, like longevity, space exploration, and finance.</p>
    <p>I also like to read, cook, play golf, and spend time with my dog, wife, family, and friends.</p>

    <h3>Personal curriculum</h3>
    <p>I try to spend at least a few hours a week going through high-quality educational courses. These are some of the best materials I've used recently on my ongoing learning journey:</p>

    <h3>Golf</h3>
    <p>When the weather permits, you can find me on the golf course. I'm always working on improving my game and enjoy the challenge and tranquility that golf provides.</p>
