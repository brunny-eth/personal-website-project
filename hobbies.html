<h2>Hobbies</h2>

<div class="page-intro">
    <p>I spend most of my time working at <a href="https://pluto.xyz/">Pluto</a> or tinkering on side projects.</p>
    <p>When I get some free time, I learn more about the world. My main focus areas today are computer science and cryptography, but I also try to learn about some other unrelated topics I find interesting, like longevity, space exploration, and the deep intricacies of finance. I follow along to free online university courses, read books, listen to podcasts, and generally do my best to stay constantly curious about the world. </p>
    <p>I also like to cook, play golf, and hang out with my family, friends, and my dog Manu.</p>

    <summary>Reading</summary>
    <div class="details-content">
        <p>I'm an avid reader. Here are some of my favorites:</p>
        <div class="book-list">
            <div class="book-item">
                <h4>The Three-Body Problem Trilogy by Cixin Liu</h4>
                <div class="book-meta">
                    <strong>Description:</strong> A sci-fi trilogy that explores the centuries-long consequences of humanity's first contact with an alien civilization.
                </div>
                <div class="book-meta">
                    <strong>My thoughts:</strong> The best sci-fi books I've ever read. A unique perspective on humanity's place in the universe. Lots of game theory and technological optimism sprinkled throughout the 3 books... and plenty of dark, sobering pieces too.

            <div class="book-item">
                <h4>The Chip by J.R. Reid</h4>
                <div class="book-meta">
                    <strong>Description:</strong> How two Americans invented the silicon microchip and launched the global information industry.
                </div>
                <div class="book-meta">
                    <strong>My thoughts:</strong> For such a complicated technical topic, this book does a great job going through the history of how technologists went from 'electrons moving through a vacuum' to 'hundreds of billions of chips all around us'. Semi-technical but not dense at all.

                    <strong>My thoughts:</strong> Phenomenal, inspiring book. Thought it would be very self-help-y but it was just beautiful.

                    <strong>My thoughts:</strong> Interesting, thought provoking. An underrated story about the war on crypto(graphy).

                <h4>The Black Cloud by Fred Hoyle</h4>

                <div class="book-meta">
                    <strong>My thoughts:</strong> Really fun book. High quality writing that doesn't lose any power in the 70+ years since it first came out.

        <p>And here are some books that often appear on "Must Read" lists, but that I don't actually recommend to others:</p>

        <div class="book-list">
            <div class="book-item not-recommended">
                <h4>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenace by Robert Pirsig</h4>
                <div class="book-meta">
                    <strong>Description:</strong> A philosophical novel about a father-son motorcycle trip across America.
                </div>
                <div class="book-meta">
                    <strong>My thoughts:</strong> I have many friends who strongly disagree with me on this one. Mostly, I just found it slow and boring. Reading it felt like driving down Nebraska cornfields for hours at a time - novel at first but the novelty wears off quickly.

            <div class="book-item not-recommended">
                <h4>Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman by Richard Feynman</h4>
                <div class="book-meta">
                    <strong>Description:</strong> An edited collection of reminiscences by the Nobel Prizeâ€“winning physicist Richard Feynman.
                </div>
                <div class="book-meta">
                    <strong>My thoughts:</strong> I really wanted to like this book. And it *does* have lots of little gems. But his writing style had too much rambling / meandering into random directions for my liking.

                <h4>Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson</h4>
                <div class="book-meta">
                    <strong>Description:</strong> The biography of Steve Jobs.
                </div>
                <div class="book-meta">
                    <strong>My thoughts:</strong> Interesting, but far too long for my taste. Became redundant and repetitive. Almost turned me off from reading Walter Isaacson's Elon Musk biography, which I ended up finding much more interesting than this one. No disrespect intended to Steve Jobs, but far from my favorite book.

    <summary>Golf</summary>
    <div class="details-content">
        <p>When the weather permits, you can find me on the golf course. Golf pushes me to be outside in nature with friends, unplugged from the rest of the world and focused solely on getting the little white ball into the hole in as few strokes as possible. It's a mental and physical challenge and it takes tons of discipline to get good at golf (I am still working on getting 'good' at golf).</p>
