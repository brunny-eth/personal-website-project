## Personal website project

this is a hobby project to build a personal website from scratch and host it on a Raspberry Pi. 

i'll be running this on a [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B](https://vilros.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b-1?variant=40809478750302) and using Claude as my personal tutor. 

i'll also use this README to track progress

Added a 'hobbies' page with no content for now; fixed issue with tabs on top of screen being inconsistent across pages.

Added more blog posts to the site, fixed some more styling issues.

#### 10-06-2024

Added a couple of blog posts to the site, and fixed styling on the blog page. its requiring a lot of manual work to copy over my blog posts from [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/brunny.eth) into markdown for the site, but can't seem to find another way to do it. 

Lesson learned: future blog posts will just be written directly in markdown rather than using a site like Mirror.
