<h2>hobbies</h2>

<div class="page-intro">
    <p>I spend most of my time working at <a href="https://pluto.xyz/">Pluto</a> or tinkering on side projects.</p>
    <p>When I get some free time, I learn more about the world through a curated personal curriculum focused on a weird mix of basic computer science, cryptography, and a bunch of other unrelated topics I find interesting, like longevity, space exploration, and finance.</p>
    <p>I also like to read, cook (see my <a href="https://faint-smile-2e4.notion.site/Recipes-08b512690f054e58a760e17305632620">running list of recipes</a>), play golf, and hang out with my puppy Manu.</p>
